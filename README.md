# Overview of SAXSess Measurements

There are two Jupyter Notebooks for giving an overview or generating overview plots:

- **[Overview of SAXSess Measurements](Overview of SAXSess Measurements.ipynb):** Takes multiple groups of measurement IDs and generates a combined plot with the group name as title for each group of IDs.
- **[Make SAXS Overview Notebook](Make SAXS Overview Notebook.ipynb):** This notebook goes through the current directory structure and creates a new notebook with a cell of plotting code for each `.PDH` file found and an overview table of parameters found in the measurement metadata Excel file.
